# maze_ts
This project aims to demonstrate a simplified typescript implementation of the Recursive Backtracking Algorithm, which is commonly used for maze generation. However, instead of generating mazes, this algorithm is employed to fill an HTML canvas element with a red color, proceeding through each step systematically. During the process, a black pixel is drawn when moving forward, while red pixels are drawn during the backtracking phase. The animation is intentionally delayed for each step, resulting in a visually satisfying display.

## Usage
The compiled application can be found on [this Github pages link](https://thewilley.github.io/maze_ts/).
